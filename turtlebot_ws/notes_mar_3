- DONE fix typo at end of line for ps3 controller in basic launch (no />, just >)
- amcl needs to be launched from the robot (but the rviz viewer should be launched from the external laptop)
- if we're launch amcl, we should NOT be launching 3dsensor (amcl takes care of this and there are conflicts if you try to launch both)
	- this should be fine once we stop using amcl-demo
- DONE fix references to gazebo and navigation, for the amcl nodes make sure that they're correct
- IN TODO NOW in the exercise room, make sure that the robot goes SLOWER, especially right after entering, because the floor lip could cause it to fall over if it goes over it at a high speed.
- try to run everything via ssh so it can be monitored
- IN TODO NOW on a day where nobody is around (so morning or evening), try to map out the leftmost area (machine shop, etc.) with gmapping, and draw in permanent obstacles to the regular map
- REQUIRES MORE TESTING need to be careful about times when a valid plan ends up being unreachable, robot will get as close as possible but it is difficult to know what will cause it to stop
- DONE fix the grey line doorways in the map, all doorways that lead to other hallways should be white (otherwise robot doesn't know that it can travel there)
- change origin on map so that it actually lines up with the bottom part of the main hallway (where the turtlebots are stored). just makes it a little easier to get going
- might have to drop the max speed down based on what will be able to actually detect qr codes
- confirm with tim.. are all codes going to be on the wall? can they be on the floor? on the wall, is there a height we can expect?




NEW NOTES - MARCH 22
- bluetooth wasn't on by default. if this is the case, may have to:
	sudo chmod +x /usr/sbin/bluetoothd
	sudo service bluetooth restart
- need to give move_base/amcl our OWN parameters file so we can set max velocity, etc. accordingly
	- just copy how it's done for bstars_sim
- try to reduce costmap to reduce "wavy" behaviour between waypoints (going away from walls when we want it close to walls)
- try to increase tolerance on waypoints to see if it drives through them more continuously
- set max speed to 0.25 m/s (DWAPlannerROS and either x max speed or trans max speed, try both in sim)
