APRIL 6 - NOTES



- REQUIRES MORE TESTING need to be careful about times when a valid plan ends up being unreachable, robot will get as close as possible but it is difficult to know what will cause it to stop


NEW NOTES - MARCH 22
- bluetooth wasn't on by default. if this is the case, may have to:
	sudo chmod +x /usr/sbin/bluetoothd
	sudo service bluetooth restart
- DONE need to give move_base/amcl our OWN parameters file so we can set max velocity, etc. accordingly
	- just copy how it's done for bstars_sim
- DONE try to reduce costmap to reduce "wavy" behaviour between waypoints (going away from walls when we want it close to walls)
	- fixed by increasing the cost_scaling_factor (on both local and global cost map) to 20 (need to test on actual robot)
		- TODO: add this to a parameter file that we're going to load
		- /move_base/global_costmap/inflation_layer/cost_scaling_factor
		- same but for local_costmap
- DONE try to increase tolerance on waypoints to see if it drives through them more continuously
	- /move_base/DWAPlannerROS/xy_goal_tolerance - try 0.3 instead of 0.15
	- /move_base/DWAPlannerROS/yaw_goal_tolerance
- DONE set max speed to 0.25 m/s (DWAPlannerROS and either x max speed or trans max speed, try both in sim)
	- add to parameters
	- /move_base/DWAPlannerROS/max_trans_vel
	- /move_base/DWAPlannerROS/max_vel_x
- DONE try to glue new gmapped rooms to the actual map, then test them out
- move robot backward for a second or two when it's on the base as a "initial move off base" command, instead of instantly going to first waypoint
- load ALL of the default move_base and amcl parameters, instead of just ours (and load them BEFORE loading our custom ones, so our custom ones will overwrite). that way, if someone totally screwed up the existing files, we can still save ourselves.
	- follow how we're loading our own for move_base


MAP:
- DONE move hallway on top all the way to the left
- DONE add curtain back to top hallway
- DONE remove little jut out on bottom of top hallway (the little angled section has a smooth transition to the lower half of the hallway)

measurements
FIXED utility room: left end to side of door for top hall: 4.7m = 94 pixels
side of door to wall :1.92m = 38 pixels
	- this wall is not in the diagram at all. add it.
end of doors coming in (wall) to beginning of doors coming in: 1.05m = 21 pixels
edge of white section of top hallway to doors on left: 11.9m = 238 pixels
LEFT edge of white section to bottom hallway left side: 4m
door length: .9m = 18
