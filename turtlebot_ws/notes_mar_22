- REQUIRES MORE TESTING need to be careful about times when a valid plan ends up being unreachable, robot will get as close as possible but it is difficult to know what will cause it to stop


NEW NOTES - MARCH 22
- bluetooth wasn't on by default. if this is the case, may have to:
	sudo chmod +x /usr/sbin/bluetoothd
	sudo service bluetooth restart
- DONE need to give move_base/amcl our OWN parameters file so we can set max velocity, etc. accordingly
	- just copy how it's done for bstars_sim
- DONE try to reduce costmap to reduce "wavy" behaviour between waypoints (going away from walls when we want it close to walls)
	- fixed by increasing the cost_scaling_factor (on both local and global cost map) to 20 (need to test on actual robot)
		- TODO: add this to a parameter file that we're going to load
		- /move_base/global_costmap/inflation_layer/cost_scaling_factor
		- same but for local_costmap
- DONE try to increase tolerance on waypoints to see if it drives through them more continuously
	- /move_base/DWAPlannerROS/xy_goal_tolerance - try 0.3 instead of 0.15
	- /move_base/DWAPlannerROS/yaw_goal_tolerance
- DONE set max speed to 0.25 m/s (DWAPlannerROS and either x max speed or trans max speed, try both in sim)
	- add to parameters
	- /move_base/DWAPlannerROS/max_trans_vel
	- /move_base/DWAPlannerROS/max_vel_x
- try to glue new gmapped rooms to the actual map, then test them out
